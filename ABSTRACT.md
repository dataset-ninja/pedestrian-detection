**Pedestrian Detection** dataset addresses the challenge of false positives in person detection, a critical subfield of object detection essential for applications like person tracking, intelligent surveillance systems, and autonomous vehicles. consists of 944 *train* images, 160 *val* images, and 235 *test* images, with a total of 1626 *person* and 1368 *person-like* labelling.

Some objects have very similar features to those of a person. If a model is trained using a dataset containing only persons, it leads to several false positives since it cannot differentiate such objects from that of a person. Our dataset includes person and person-like objects (PnPLO). Person-like objects that authors introduce in our dataset are statues, mannequins, scarecrows, and robots. Authors used the SSD model to show that, on training a model using our dataset, authors can significantly reduce the false positives during detection when compared to models trained on standard person datasets, thereby improving the precision.
